  @moduledoc """
  Guards the `:phoenix_kit` requirement against being re-narrowed to a single
  core MINOR, and against a local path override reaching a commit.

  The trap is the three-segment form: `~> 2.0.x` expands to
  `>= 2.0.x and < 2.1.0`, so no 2.1 or later core satisfies it. The breakage
  lands on CONSUMERS, never here — a host depending on both this module and a
  newer core minor gets an unsolvable dependency set and `mix deps.get` fails
  outright, with no degraded mode. Nothing else in this repo's own test run
  would notice, which is why the check is a test rather than a convention.

  Core 1.7 is deliberately excluded: core 2.0.0 squashed the migration chain to
  a V135 floor and this module is verified only against that baseline.

  **The floor is 2.38.0** — the actor and activity log come from
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Actor` and `Activity.log/3`, the template image scope folder
  from `Storage.ResourceFolders`, and the edit forms use
  `mount_multilang(open_on:)`; an older core does not compile the package. The
  earlier floor, 2.21.3, had two reasons of its own that still hold below it:

  - `Template.changeset/2` calls `PhoenixKit.Utils.Slug.put_slug/3`, which
    core did not ship until 2.4.0 — admitting 2.0.x would let a host resolve
    a core where every save touching `:name` raises `UndefinedFunctionError`.
  - `Paths.integrations/0` and `Paths.new_integration/0` link to
    `/admin/settings/integrations[/new]` as the website-wide connections page.
    Core 2.4–2.18 served the *personal* page at that path, 2.19–2.21.2 served
    the website page at `/admin/settings/integrations/website`, and 2.21.3
    renamed it to the bare path. Admitting anything below 2.21.3 ships a link
    that lands on a page which cannot show the connection the picker listed.

  Both are the *same class* of consumer-only breakage this test exists to
  catch, just from the opposite direction: too wide rather than too narrow.

  Raising the floor is NOT the trap described above. `>= 2.38.0 and < 3.0.0`
  is patch-precise at the bottom and open at the top, so it still admits every
  later core minor; the forbidden shape is the three-segment `~> 2.38.0`,
  which would pin to a single minor and is rejected by the `@must_admit`
  entries below.
